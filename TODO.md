# TODO

Add functionality to the repo and update README file accordingly.

---

## Hints

Add a `hints.ipynb` file to each day's folder.

Also, add the following to the README file:

```
Because I believe in attempting to find solutions of your own accord, I have included within each solution directory a `hints.ipynb` file. I encourage any programmers looking for help with any of the challenges to first check out this file before going straight to the `solution.ipynb` file.
```
