# Advent of Code (2022)

My Python 3 solutions for each of the 25 challenges for the Advent of Code event of 2022.

Each challenge has its own directory, which contains the challenge description, input data, and solution.

### Project Description 

(From the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/)):

*Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas.*

*For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle.*

*The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.*

*To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th.*

*Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.*

**Collect stars by solving puzzles.**

*Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.*

*Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!*

## Repository Purpose

I created this repo as a way to show my Python abilities to any future employers.

Also, I hope someone will find iti  well as to help anyone struggling with any of the challenges.
