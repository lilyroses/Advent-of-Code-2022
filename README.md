# Advent of Code (2022)

My Python 3 solutions for each of the 25 challenges for the Advent of Code event of 2022.

Each challenge has its own directory, which contains the challenge description, input data, hints, and solution.

## Purpose

Completing the Advent of Code challenges gave me a chance to add solid repository to my Github repertoire, which furthers my goal of showcasing my coding abilities for future employers. 

I have made an effort to create solutions that are as organized, modular, efficient, and Pythonic as possible.

I have made every attempt to showcase not only my proficiency with the language but also my awareness of Pythonic style, proper documentation and commenting, and usage of algorithms where appropriate.

Adhering to programming best practices and creating readable, maintainable code is as important of writing code that does what it is supposed to.

Also, if these solutions help future learners who are struggling with the challenges, I am glad to provide reference material.

Because I believe in attempting to find solutions of your own accord, I have included within each solution directory a `hints.ipynb` file. I encourage any programmers looking for help with any of the challenges to first check out this file before going straight to the `solution.ipynb` file.

## Project Structure

Within each solution folder are several files:

- `instructions.md` : Instructions for that challenge, copied and pasted directly from the webiste.

- `input.txt` : The input data for that challenge.

- `hints.ipynb` : Hints for solving the challenge. If you are stuck, check here first!

- `day_[x].ipynb` : The code for the solution itself, in an interactive Jupyter notebook.
