# Advent of Code (2022)

My Python 3 solutions for each of the 25 challenges for the Advent of Code event of 2022.

Each challenge has its own directory, which contains the challenge description, input data, and solution. 

---

## Purpose

I created this repo as a way to show my Python abilities, as well as to help anyone struggling with any of the challenges.

---

## Project Structure

Within each solution folder are several files:

- `instructions.md` : Instructions for that challenge, copied and pasted directly from the webiste.

- `input.txt` : The input data for that challenge.

- `solution.ipynb` : The code for the solution itself, in an interactive Jupyter notebook.
